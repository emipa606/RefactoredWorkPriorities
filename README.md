Grants you additional control over colonists, including some tweaks to their work priorities and schedules.

The mod includes an options menu (Options  Mod Settings).



- **Injured animals** will be fed by handlers instead of doctors.
- **Removing roofs** prioritised above building roofs.
- **Custom repair threshold** - you decide when repairs should be made.
- **Repair designator** - force repairs on buildings above the repair threshold.
- **Prioritise rottables** - haul corn, meals etc. as a high priority.
- **Prioritise deterioratables** - haul items as a high priority.
- **Set an item HP threshold** to avoid prioritising items with low HP.
